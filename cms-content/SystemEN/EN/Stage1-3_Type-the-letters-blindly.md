## The Palantype Alphabet

How about you type the letters in their proper order without the virtual keyboard?

The choice of letters in the Palantype alphabet is based on their frequency in written English.
Only the most common letters are represented directly.
You will learn how to reach any other letter fairly easily by using the `+` and the `^` keys.
