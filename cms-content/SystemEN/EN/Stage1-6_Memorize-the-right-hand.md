### Exercise 6

## The Palantype Alphabet

Switching hands now. The leading `-` symbol indicates that the letter is on your right-hand side.

Type every steno letter as it appears!

By the way, the order of keys in the Palantype alphabet underwent important optimizations, too.
In the Palantype system, any finger is meant to press down only one key at a time.
It follows immediately that keys that are in the same column (treating thumb rows as columns, too) cannot appear both in a single chord.

This is bad news for the Pterodactylus: It can't be typed without some special rule, because `PTE` is not a valid chord, even though all the letters are there.
The actual order of the keys tries to account for the most common letter combinations in the real English language first.
