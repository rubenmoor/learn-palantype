### Exercise 1

## The Palantype Alphabet

Palantype relies on chords. A chord means: You press up to ten keys at the same time.
The order in which you press down does not matter.
Instead, all the letters of one chord will appear in their proper order.
Therefore, you will learn the Palantype Alphabet in its proper order now.

Type the following steno letters in order, one after another.

Some letters occur twice, the first time for your left hand and the second time for your right hand.
