# Stage 1

### Exercise 8

## The Palantype Alphabet

Before your continue with this last exercise of Stage 1:
There is a table of contents on the left.
Use it to jump back to any of the previous exercises to practice some more.

Type every steno letter as it appears!

By the way, you can re-shuffle the order, in which the keys are presented to you, by reloading the page, if you feel the need to.

### A remark on learning strategy

I personally feel more comfortable practicing whole steno chords in the upcoming exercises
once I perfectly remember the position of each individual key.
Every single exercise will introduce new rules to remember and I prefer not to get distracted by searching for keys and looking up at the virtual keyboard.

Having said that, the opposite case can be argued, too:
You will go through a lot of exercises, each of them repeating all of the rules again and again.
By the time you reach the last exercise of Stage 3 you will have memorized the key positions regardlessly.

The real lesson is that, quite often, different strategies work well for different persons.
If you are going to master stenographic typing, you probably have a good idea about learning strategies that work for you.
If you don't, I encourage you to take a break once in a while and reflect on your progress.

The single best advice that I ever got when it comes to learning:
Don't get lost in a system. Any system is just a crutch that you throw away once you learned to walk.
Systems, apps and interactive tutorials like this one, can be quite devious in that they come with a reward system.
The one reward that counts, however, is mastering your very own goal that led you to stenographic typing in the first place!

And as long as you do not lose focus regarding your original goal, everything is allowed.
Following the path of your personal interests is a great way of learning, especially for a big project like learning stenographic typing.
