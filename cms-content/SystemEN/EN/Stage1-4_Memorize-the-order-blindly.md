### Exercise 4

## The Palantype Alphabet

And for maximum difficulty, type the letters in their proper order without seeing neither the letters nor the keyboard!
To make this a bit of a challenge:
First, don't look at your fingers.
Second, try to speak out loud every letter, before you are going to type it.
