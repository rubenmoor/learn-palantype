# Stage 1

### Exercise 7

## The Palantype Alphabet

This one will be fun.
You won't have to move your hands at all.
All the keys you practice in this exercise lie on home row.
If you find your hands moving, still, maybe adjust your keyboard.
Home row should be reachable with as little movement as possible.

Be sure to practice this one to perfection. It will only get more difficult from here.
