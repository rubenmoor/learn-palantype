# Stage 2

### Exercise 2

## Syllables and chords

We can begin with actually typing sentences now.
How about this one sentences I found in the
[Palantype Tutorial](http://www.openstenoproject.org/palantype/tutorial/2016/08/21/learn-palantype.html)
of the Open Steno Project?
In case you have trouble with keys that appear twice on the steno keyboard:
There is always only exactly one correct key that results in the desired output.

<!--separator-->

Each word is one chord, except the word «lazy».
You will have to strike `LE^` and `S+I` separately.
For this reason, the steno code for «lazy» is typically denoted `LE^/S+I`, with a `/`.

You will probably need an additional chord to clear this task: `ULFTS`.
It is the home row of your right hand and deletes your last input.
Now you can correct your mistakes!
