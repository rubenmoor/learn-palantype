## Why Palantype

Palantype allows you to type with lightning speed. It's a stenographic system in the wider sense. The most widespread of these systems is simply called steno. Any steno-style system requires quite a bit of learning. Palantype has the advantage that it's more suitable for regular keyboards. There are limitations, though.

## Requirements

### Hardware

You can get started with your regular keyboard. However, keyboards usually have limit of how many keys register at the same time. Long term, you will need a keyboard that supports N-Key roll-over (NKRO) to type chords of up to ten keys. In addition, a ortho-linear layout as well as very sensitive keys are preferable.

You can play around with the keyboard above to see how much keys register at the same time with your hardware.

### Software

All of this is made possible by the [Open Steno Project](http://www.openstenoproject.org/). The software [Plover](http://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/) is part of the project and is all you need to get serious. As long as you practice here, you don't need Plover. Once you installed and configured Plover however, you can upload your Plover configuration here to practice with the same key map.

> **Current state of the project**
>
> The steno dictionary for German contains 1,945,685 words. Additional words are added regularly. Among the quality-of-life features are: command keys (Home, End, Insert, Delete, ...), special characters, fingerspelling, and plover commands for actual text formatting.

Instead of clicking the button, try to input `DSAÜD` by pressing D-, S-, A-, -Ü, -D all at once. Take your time finding the next key while holding down. The chord is only registered once you release all the keys.
