# Typing numbers

## Palantype number mode

### Digits and related symbols

For typing numbers, the virtual keyboard above can assist you quite a bit.
Click on "Show special modes" to activate visualization of special input.
Then just hold down `B+-` and you can see, how to reach numbers and related symbols.

Note how, apart from the digits 0-9 for the fingers of your right hand,
the extra keys for the thumbs allow to input even longer numbers all at once,
in particular common dates like *1990*, or *2022*.

Also, the input of common shortcuts that involve numbers
is possible by adding a modifier key to any input.
The available modifiers are `Control`, `Super`, and `Alt`.
`Super` is usually called the Windows-key.

### Navigating the table of contents using numbers

If you haven't noticed already,
the table of contents of this website can be accessed
by typing a number with the `Control` modifier key.
E.g. `Ctrl + 0` brings you to the introduction.
`Ctrl + 1` opens the exercises of the first stage;
from there, it's just `Control` plus the number of the exercise.

### The special characters of number mode

Following the standard US keyboard layout,
you can reach special characters using the Shift modifier key
in combination with a number key.
The virtual keyboard assists you here again.

Note that access to these special chars via the number mode
shouldn't be usually necessary when typing regularly.
Rather, consider them part of the extended finger spelling.
For the usual formatting, the [Exercise 15.1: Plover Commands](DE/54) should be all you ever need.

Also, there are special characters missing.
In number mode, there are only those special characters that you reach via the Shift modifier plus some number.
The remaining special characters can be found in [Exercise 15.5: Special Character](DE/58).

### Practicing dates

Feel free to practice dates here.
The format is fairly common in Germany and you will learn numbers just fine this way.
There are alternative ways to reach the same output now:
Feel free to type digit by digit or use as many fingers as possible at once.
