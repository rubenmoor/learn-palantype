# Stage 10

### Exercise 1

## S-swapping in the coda

### Greediness 0

I mentioned the challenges regarding the coda before:
All too many consonants get cramped in there.
Unfortunately, the rules for dealing with *s*, *sch*, and *z* and their combination
with *t* are not the most intuitive ones.

The good news is that there are some principles that apply to all three,
*s*, *sch*, and *z*.

<!--separator-->

The first thing to note and to hold on to:
*-ts* (and *-ds*) are typed `+SD` or, depending on context just `SD`.
This is why this rule is called «S-swapping».

The small `s` key is used for the impossible cases:
*tst*, and *sts*.
