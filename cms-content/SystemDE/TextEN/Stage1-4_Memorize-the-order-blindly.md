# Stage 1

### Exercise 4

## The Palantype Alphabet

And for maximum difficulty, type the letters in their proper order without seeing neither the letters nor the keyboard!
To make this a bit of a challenge:
First, don't look at your fingers.
Second, try to speak out loud every letter, before you are going to type it.

<!--separator-->

Remember that `ʃ` is used to type *sch*?
As I told you in the last stage, less frequent letters require more keys to be pressed at once.
The `ʃ` key is an example that the opposite is also true:
By including sch as a single key in the layout, you immediately save a couple of strokes.
There is, however, an even more important reason why the `ʃ` is included as a single key:
In German, sch is combined with other letters as if it were a single letter.
Think of *Quatsch*, *Schwach*, *Dschungel*, and *Plantschst*!

Given these heavy syllable, creating steno codes that fit into single chords turns out to be a major headache.
The task is simplified quite a bit by reducing the sch to a single key.
This simplification is important for both, the algorithm that creates the steno codes and you,
the learner that will sooner or later memorize them.
