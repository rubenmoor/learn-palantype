# Stage 2

### Exercise 1

## Syllables and chords

You probably have noticed that on the virtual keyboard some keys are highlighted blue.
These keys are called home row.
The idea is that there is a resting position for your hands,
where every finger is placed on one key of home row.

From this resting position your fingers can find any key,
without any need to look down on your keyboard,
so your eyes can stay on the screen all the time.

In case you have been looking on your fingers during the exercises,
it's probably a good idea to get used to home row now.
Simply repeat Stage 1 until you can do all the exercises without looking down.
Just orient yourself once in the beginning!

Type **↤** `I+NSD` to [go back to Exercise 1.1](/SystemDE/TextEN/1) to practice home row.

Also, just like looking down on your fingers will slow you down,
you can't actually use the virtual keyboard if you want to get up to speed. I
recommend, turning it off.
The following exercise is an important prerequisite to actually learn the chords.

Maybe, you want to come up with a mnemonic phrase that helps remembering the keyboard layout, e.g.

**V**er**D**or**b**ene
**Sch**warze **S**tern**F**rucht
**G**e**N**ieß**B**ar
mit **M**ilch **+** **L**ebertran

**Ä**tna-**E**ruption **A**ußergewöhnlich **Lang**

**U**rgewalt **I**mmens **O**hne **Ü**berlebende

You can surely come up with a better one, yourself!

This one is for the homerow:

**D**ussel **S**ind **N**iemand **+** **A**lle, **I**mmer **+** **N**ie, **S**ie **D**ussel!
