### Exercise 4

## The stretching of a in ak

### Greediness 3

The word abgehakt has a long *a*.
Just compare to *abgehackt*.
Unfortunately, there is no way to tell this kind of long *a* from a short *a* based on orthography alone.
Compare with the words *praktisch*, *Fakt*, or *Pakt*.
A solution based on orthography would be: a special steno code for *ck*
and a greedier rule that allows to treat *ck* just like *k* as long as the steno code for the whole world is unambiguous.
You see that we take another route.
In [Exercise 3.1](/SystemDE/TextEN/13) you learned that *k* and *ck* are treated with the same steno.
The reason is that the need to differentiate between the two is so rare that we treat it as exception.

In this exercise you find words with a long vowel before the *k*.
And this long vowel is stretched using the stretch key.

The idea behind this rule:
You can still largely treat *k* and *ck* the same and will only encounter problems when you hit upon one of the above words.
