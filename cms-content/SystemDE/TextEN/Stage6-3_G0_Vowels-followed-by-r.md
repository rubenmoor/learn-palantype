# Stage 6

### Exercise 3

## Vowels followed by r

### Greediness 0

This might come as a little surprise but, just like with *h*,
the letter *r* doesn't have a key for your right hand, either, and it is typed using the same stretch keys.

<!--separator-->

As in the previous exercise, *ö* already uses two keys and its stretched version doesn't look any different then the unstretched *ö*.

In case you wonder: This is the reason why the stretch key is not simply called `H`.
Using one and the same key for several letters causes conflicts.
Think of the words *eh* and *er*, *Horn* and *Hohn*, *Sie* and *Sir* …
So, why going through all these troubles?
Well, in German, the coda tends to get quite juicy, combining a lot of consonants,
e.g. *plantschst*, *seufzt*, or *knirschst*.
These latter words aren't specialties but rather regular features of the language—
brought about by conjugation.
In order to accommodate these, we need to shift some weight away from the four fingers of the right hand.
The thumbs, which take care of vowels, can take over the responsibility for *h* and *r* just fine.
And even though we don't adhere to the rules of linguistics in any strict sense,
it is a welcome fact that, in German, *r* preceded by a vowel
is not pronounced anything like *r* in the onset of a syllable.
So all in all it is quite convenient to treat *r* in the coda as sort of a modifier to a vowel.
