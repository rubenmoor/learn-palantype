# Stage 2

### Exercise 3

## Syllables and chords

During the following exercises, you will learn to type words, starting with the most straightfoward ones.
You will be able to guess the correct chord without problem.

There are rules that will become progressively more complex in the course of this tutorial.
We start simple:

### Rule 1: Steno key order

Every chord consists of up to ten keys pressed at once.
Within one chord, the order in which you press down keys does not matter.
Instead, all keys of one chord will always be interpreted in their proper order.

For example, the steno keys `BUʃ` can only appear in exactly that order and always mean «Busch».
The word «Schub» has to be typed using different keys, and indeed here it is: `ʃUB`.

In conclusion, it **does** matter which key (or which hand) you use:
`ʃ-` isn't the same as `-ʃ`.
But it **does not** matter in which order you actually put down your fingers.
Ideally you press all the keys of one chord at the same time.

### Rule 2: Word part structure

One chord either makes a word or a word part.
In general, a part consists of an onset,
a nucleus, and a coda. The onset comprises the consonants in the beginning and can be missing.
The nucleus comprises the vowels that follow and the coda finally comprises the consonants in the end.

For a word part structured that way,
you will use the fingers of your left hand for the consonants of the onset
and the fingers of your right hand for the consonants of the coda.
For the nucleus you have your thumbs.

### Practice simple words

To get started, we start with the most simple words.
Every letter can be typed as it is, just make sure to use the correct finger.
The only specialty for now is *sch*, for which you will have to use `ʃ`.
And remember: the small keys `v`, `b`, `s`, and `n` are special keys.
Don't use them yet.
