# Special Characters

## The remaining ones

We are not quite done in terms of special characters.
The [Plover Commands](DE/54) got you covered for most kind of special input,
rendering a lot of the numerous keys on the conventional keyboard obsolete.
[Fingerspelling mode](DE/55) allows you to reach any (regular) letter,
to type words that are not in your dictionary.
The fingerspelling mode already contains a couple of special characters.
The [Number mode](DE/56) is really about typing numbers,
but for your convenience, combining a number with `SHIFT` mimics the behavior
of conventional keyboards.

Now there are still keys left.
Some of them are covered by the [Command keys](DE/57).
What still remains though, are non-alphanumeric characters that are not commands.
Here are they:

| Steno | Char | Char   |
|-------|------|--------|
| `v`   | &#96;| ~      |
| `G`   | -    | _      |
| `M`   | =    | +      |
| `D`   | [    | {      |
| `S`   | ]    | }      |
| `N`   | \    | &#124; |
| `+`   | '    | "      |
| `b`   | ,    | <      |
| `F`   | .    | >      |
| `B`   | ;    | :      |
| `L`   | /    | ?      |

Make sure that "Show special modes" is activated and use `-N` to reach the special characters.
Use `SHIFT`, i.e. `-D` to type the characters of the second column.
