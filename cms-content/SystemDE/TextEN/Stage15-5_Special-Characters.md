# Special Characters

## The remaining ones

We are not quite done in terms of special characters.
The [Plover Commands](/SystemDE/TextEN/54) got you covered for most kind of special input,
rendering a lot of the numerous keys on the conventional keyboard obsolete.
[Fingerspelling mode](/SystemDE/TextEN/55) allows you to reach any (regular) letter,
to type words that are not in your dictionary.
The fingerspelling mode already contains a couple of special characters.
The [Number mode](/SystemDE/TextEN/56) is really about typing numbers,
but for your convenience, combining a number with `SHIFT` mimics the behavior
of conventional keyboards.

Now there are still keys left.
Some of them are covered by the [Command keys](/SystemDE/TextEN/57).
What still remains though, are non-alphanumeric characters that are not commands.
Here are they:

| Steno | Char | Char   |
|-------|------|--------|
| `v`   | &#96;| ~      |
| `G`   | -    | _      |
| `M`   | =    | +      |
| `D`   | [    | {      |
| `S`   | ]    | }      |
| `N`   | \    | &#124; |
| `+`   | '    | "      |
| `b`   | ,    | <      |
| `F`   | .    | >      |
| `B`   | ;    | :      |
| `L`   | /    | ?      |

If you want to see the special characters in the virtual keyboard,
make sure to activate "Show special modes" there
and use `-N` to reach the special characters.
Use `SHIFT`, i.e. `-D` to type the characters of the second column.

The exercise below combines all of Fingerspelling, some numbers and special characters,
but also command keys:
You will need `RETURN` at the end of each line,
`TABULATOR` for the indentation, and finally.
`SPACE` for spaces.

In case you wonder, the above text is Haskell code.
It produces a list of German words given a set of letters,
such that the words do not contain any letter not in the set.
The whole project Palantype DE is implemented in Haskell,
including the website you are looking at.

If you want to practice fingerspelling with a different programming language
(or a different text altogether), just give me a hint on the
[Plover Discord #palantype-machine](https://discord.gg/spymr5aCr5).
