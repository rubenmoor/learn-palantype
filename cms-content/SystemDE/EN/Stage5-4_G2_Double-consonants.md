# Stage 5

### Exercise 4

## Double consonants

### Greediness 2

In this stage, this is the only exercise that has a greediness bigger then 0
and thus introduces additional efficiency.
No surprises here:
When *t* can be greedily reached by `D` and doubled consonants can be greedily reached as if they were singletons,
then we can add some greed and combine the idea of the various rules.
