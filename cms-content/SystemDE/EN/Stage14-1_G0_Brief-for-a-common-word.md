# Stage 14

### Exercise 1

## Brief for a common word

### Greediness 0

One major reason why steno typing allows for such a high speed is the existence of briefs.
A brief is a steno code that is used for one specific word or a syllable.
Technically, every brief is an additional rule.
Less technical, every brief is an exception to the rules that you learned so far.
The steno code for briefs is meant to make very common words much quicker to type.
And don't be scared:
You will see that most briefs aren't that hard to memorize.
While briefs ignore all the rules, usually they can be designed in ways that kind of make sense.

Experienced stenotypists design briefs all the time, sometimes as they type.
Imagine you are transcribing an interview with the «Bundesgesundheitsministerin»
and she keeps talking about the «Hackfleischverordnung».
Having those two words encoded as one or two chords, opposed to ten and five chords, respectively,
not only makes you quicker.
Long words can be quite demanding to type in general.

Note, however, that the briefs you are learning here are less specific.
Rather than cutting down very long words, you find the most common words of the German language here.
Often the briefs just turn a two-chord code into a single chord.
Sometimes the briefs aren't increasing efficiency but rather circumvent collisions.

While the list below contains all the information necessary to complete this exercise,
it doesn't help a lot with learning.
Within the briefs there are repeating patterns.
The following codes are built around the idea of shortening a two-syllable word to one syllable
by cutting off stuff at the end (try to guess the real-life word just by reading the code):

`DAB DAF DAGʃ OD ~ON U+ND F+~UD F+~ÜD`

The codes for *werden*, *worden*, *wurden*, and *würden* do not appear here,
as there is a regular rule already that allows to replace *den* with `-n`.

Sometimes cutting stuff at the end isn't a good strategy,
because it may result in more ambiguous steno.
Of course, we can cut stuff off the front, too. Try to guess those ones:

`DF+A DF+AS BEÜ`

For good measure, we can also cut stuff in the middle:

`FNEO+ʃ F+N`

... or a bit everywhere:

`BOGʃ`

The majority of the steno code in this exercise follows a pattern that incorporates inflection.
E.g. you can think of `LAL` as the core steno code for *all-*,
and then complete the different forms according to the table:

|        |         |         |         |         |
|-       |-        |-        |-        |-        |
| *alle* | *aller* | *alles* | *allem* | *allen* |
| `LALn` | `LALs`  | `LALS`  | `LALM`  | `LALN`  |

To come up with a name for this rule, read the endings backwards and you have the «Enemesere»-rule.
Apart from alle it applies to:

*dies-* `D~I`
:   Exception: *dieses* uses `D~ISs` as `D~IS` is in use for *dies* already.

*ein-* `EI`
:   Exception: *einen* uses the regular en-rule and thus `EINn` as `EIN` is in use for *ein* already,
    and *eines* uses `EINs` as `EIS` is in use for, well, *Eis*.

*ihr-* `~I`
:   Exception: *ihren* uses `~I+N` as `~IN` is in use for *ihn* already.

*kein-* `G+EI`
:   No Exception.

*neu-* `NE`
:   No Exception.

*sein-* `SEI`
:   No Exception.

*viel-* `FBLI`
:   No Exception.

While we covered the majority of the available briefs with explanations of their origin,
there remains a number of them being quite irregular.
In order to practice now, you might find it useful have the complete list, right here:
