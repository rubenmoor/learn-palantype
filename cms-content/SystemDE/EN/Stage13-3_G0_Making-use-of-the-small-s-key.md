Take this exercise as general practice.
German has a lot of compound words.
If you happen to use specific ones a lot, consider defining briefs.

Also check out the [Plover Plugin: plover-next-stroke](https://github.com/Kaoffie/plover_next_stroke).
It adds auto-completion to plover, which isn't as big a deal for English steno—
where the words are mostly one chord—
but for German it can be a big speedup.
