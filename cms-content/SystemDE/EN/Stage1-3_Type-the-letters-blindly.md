## The Palantype Alphabet

How about you type the letters in their proper order without the virtual keyboard?
Again, get used to remembering them!

<!--separator-->

Missing the letters *C*, *H*, *J*, *K*, *P*, *Q*, *R*, *T*, *V*, *W*, *X*, *Y*, and *Z*?
The choice of letters in the Palantype alphabet is based on their frequency in written German.
Only the most common letters are represented directly.
It's worth mentioning that the missing letters *K*, *P*, and *T* are quite common, too,
and you will learn that they can be reached fairly easily by combining either one of *G*, *B*, and *D* with the `+` key.

Technically, *Ö* and *ß* are also missing.
The less frequent a letter, the more keys you will have to combine into one chord to reach it.
This makes any steno system extremely flexible regarding special letters, regardless of their frequency.
Palantype DE accounts even for the french letters *ç*, and *é*.
