# Stage 3

### Exercise 3

## Fitting a consonant in between +D

### Greediness 0

The new rules of this exercise all follow from one single rule:
*t* is typed by `+D`.
But there is a lot space between those two keys to squeeze in another consonant when needed.

<!--separator-->

This is not the whole story, though.
First, exceptions are needed for *mt* and *lt*, where the `+` cannot be reached.
It turns out that the `+` isn't really necessary there, either.
There are a couple of ambiguities, e.g. «holt» and «hold», but they can be dealt with as exceptions.
You will notice quickly that the `+` is omitted quite often—
for a little bit increased typing efficiency.
In the case of *scht*, omitting the `+` has the additional advantage
that `-+ʃD` now exclusively means *cht*, which keeps things nice and simple.
