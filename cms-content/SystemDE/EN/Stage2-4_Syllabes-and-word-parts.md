# Stage 2

### Exercise 4

## Syllables and chords

Introducing words that rely on two or more chords to type now.
In general, the idea of any steno system is typing efficiency and the less chords you need to type a word, the better.
There are, however, several reasons why especially German words do not always fit into one steno chord.
In that case, the words are simply split up and you type the corresponding chord in succession to produce the word.

As a rule of thumb, words are split up along their orthographic syllables,
e.g. we saw «Zweifel» as `SWEI/FEL` in [Exercise 2.2](DE/10).
In the same exercise we saw «Wissen» as `WISn`,
thus orthographic syllables are not respected, after all?
Well, there are alternative spellings and you can choose to type `WIS/SEN`, too.
Thus our next rule:

### Rule 3: syllables and word parts

Words that contain more than one syllable can be typed by typing the syllables separately, one after the other.

### Simple substitution rules

Like with a lot of rules, there are exceptions.
We don't need to bother right now, the words of this exercise are not affected.
Just that you now, sometimes you will have to type chords that span multiple syllables
and sometimes you will need multiple chords to type a single syllable.
For this reason we generally speak of word parts instead of syllables.

For completeness sake, find below the "substitution rules" that have been applied so far.
They look trivial still, but will more complicated soon enough.

Each lowercase letter in the table is a letter of natural language.
Next to it you find a steno code, denoted as uppercase letter.
The entries are sorted alphabetically.
