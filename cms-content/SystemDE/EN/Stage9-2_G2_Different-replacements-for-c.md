### Exercise 2

## Different replacements for c

### Greediness 2

As promised, the efficient way of typing *C*.
Note that quite often the pronunciation doesn't actually fit:
While *Caf√©* as `G+A/FE` is somewhat logical, *City* as `G+I/D+I` not so much.
**Palantype DE** is an orthographic system:
While it would be nice to allow a more intuitive way to type *c* when its
pronunciation doesn't resemble *k*, this would amount to a lot of exceptions
in the algorithm.
