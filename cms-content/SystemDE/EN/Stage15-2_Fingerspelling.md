# Fingerspelling

## Palantype fingerspelling mode

Whenever a word does not exist in the installed dictionary,
you won't be able to type it according to the rules presented here.
Of course, the idea is that efficient steno chords exist for any conceivable situation,
however ...

There are

* very rare words, not yet accounted for by the algorithm,
* loanwords, partially accounted for by means of explicit exceptions,
* abbreviations and symbols, partially accounted for,
* and diverging ways on how to write things.

This goes to say:
If a word doesn't come out right, there is a troubleshooting procedure.
Maybe there is a proper steno spelling, you just don't know it?
In that case, you might want to look up the word within the dictionary, using Plover.
If, however, there is no steno code for whatever you want to write,
you have a general alternative that is called fingerspelling.
I.e. there are steno codes for every single letter (and digit, special character, and command key)
and, this way, it is possible to type sequentially, letter by letter, using steno.

### Standard letters

The Standard Letters are simply all those letters that are present on the US keyboard layout.
They have special significance, because they commonly feature in shortcuts,
like `CTRL+C` or `CTRL+-` (to zoom out in your internet browser).
And indeed, the palantype fingerspelling mode accounts for that by providing modifier keys:
`CTRL`, `WIN`, `ALT`, and `SHIFT`.
Note that `SHIFT` is a secondary modifier and can be added on top of the other modifiers.
This is why `SHIFT` has a finger apart from them.

Be aware that `WIN`, a key whose actual name is `SUPER`,
appears strictly as modifier here.
In case you want to tap the `WIN` key, e.g. to open the Start menu on the
Microsoft Windows operating system,
the `WIN` key shows up among the keys in [Ex. 15.4 Command Keys](DE/57).

Use `-L` and `-D` (SHIFT) in combination with the keys below, to start fingerspelling!

### Modifier keys

| SHIFT | CTRL | WIN | ALT |
|-------|------|-----|-----|
| `-D`  | `-Êƒ` | `-S`| `-F`|

### Fingerspelling literals

The codes here shouldn't surprise you.
It's all patterns you know already.

### Non-standard letters

There is nothing special about the following letters.
They can be combined with SHIFT for their uppercase version
but they aren't keys on a regular keyboard, so they are not part of shortcuts.

### Beyond text transcription

Fingerspelling is a powerfull feature.
Together with [Ex. 15.4 Command Keys](DE/57),
you can reach conventional key bindings in steno mode without any additional configuration.
Your usual shortcuts just turn into steno code, if you like--and they easily fit into a single chord.
