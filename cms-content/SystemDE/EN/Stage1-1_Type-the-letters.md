### Exercise 1

## The Palantype Alphabet

Palantype relies on chords. A chord means: You press up to ten keys at the same time. The order in which you press down does not matter. Instead, all the letters of one chord will appear in their proper order. Therefore, you will learn the Palantype Alphabet in its proper order now.

Type the following steno letters in order, one after another.

Some letters occur twice, the first time for your left hand and the second time for your right hand.

In case you wonder: The letter `ʃ` is a phonetic symbol related to the German *sch*.
We don't care about exact phonetics and thus simply treat `ʃ` as *sch*.

Also, the keys with small letters are special.
`v`, `b`, and `n` stand for *ver-*, *be-*, and *-en*, respectively.
These keys aren't necessary and you won't use them in a while.
E.g. *be* can be typed simply by typing `BE`.
But given the high frequency of these word parts, these special keys will help a lot with typing efficiency.
The `s` key (small s) is a specical key among the special keys and has whole exercises dedicated to its use.
