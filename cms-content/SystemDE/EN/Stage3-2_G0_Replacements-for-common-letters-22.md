# Stage 3

### Exercise 2

## Replacements for common letters 2/2

### Greediness 0

The rules for the replacement of common letters are somewhat arbitrarily split in two.
This is the second half.

<!--separator-->

The idea behind *phr* is to combine *f* (the pronounciation of *ph*) with *r*.
The *schw-* rule is indeed arbitrary and results from the fact that `ʃ` and `F` cannot be reached at the same time.
The same is true for *zw-*.

The *sp* rule is a simplification of `SB+`, which is possible because *sb* isn't really a thing in German.
The *st* rule is the first example of a swap—in combination with the fact that *sd* doesn't exist in German.
The onset *y* is encoded in its use as a consonant here, like in «Yoghurt».
Note the different code for its vowel user in the nucleus.
This onset code is also used for [Exercise 15.2: Fingerspelling](DE/55), i.e. to type just the letter *Y*.

For the coda, you find a lot of cases where somewhat arbitrary rules follow from necessity.
Consonant combinations in the coda are just too plentiful in German.
