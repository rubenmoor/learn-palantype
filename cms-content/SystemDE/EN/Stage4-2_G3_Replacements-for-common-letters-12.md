### Exercise 2

## Replacements for common letters 1/2

### Greediness 3

Jumping back to *Replacements of Common Words 1* once more,
with increased greediness.
By chosing a higher value for the greediness for this particular rule,
we make sure that the algorithm that generates the steno dictionary applies this rule as an independent optimization.

Because the greedy optimizations fail every time
the resulting code is already in use by some other, more frequent word.
