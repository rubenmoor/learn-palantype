# Stage 1

### Exercise 7

## The Palantype Alphabet

This one will be fun.
You won't have to move your hands at all.
All the keys you practice in this exercise lie on home row.
If you find your hands moving, still, maybe adjust your keyboard.
Home row should be reachable with as little movement as possible.

Be sure to practice this one to perfection. It will only get more difficult from here.

You probably understand now, why the special keys `v`, `b`, `n`, and `s` are placed in the outermost columns along with `D`.
I mentioned earlier that `v` and `b` encode the common prefixes *ver-* and *be-*.
`n` encodes the extremely frequent suffix *-en*.
Thus, in order to reduce longish words like «vermischen» to one single chord,
`v`, in principle, needs to be combined with any other letter.
Conversely, any other letter at the end, in principle, needs to be combined with `n`,
resulting in the very compact steno `vMIʃn` for a three syllablle word.
