### Exercise 6

## The Palantype Alphabet

Switching hands now. The leading `-` symbol indicates that the letter is on your right-hand side.

Type every steno letter as it appears!

<!--separator-->

By the way, the order of keys in the Palantype alphabet underwent important optimizations, too.
In the Palantype system, any finger is meant to press down only one key at a time.
It follows immediately that keys that are in the same column (treating thumb rows as columns, too) cannot appear both in a single chord.

This is bad news for the Gnu: It can't be typed without some special rule, because `GNU` is not a valid chord, even though all the letters are there.
The actual order of the keys tries to account for the most common letter combinations in the real German language first.
A case can be made to swap the keys *D* and *S*, given the high frequency of *st* in the beginning and *ts* in the end of German words.
However, the *t* also frequently combines with literally any other consonant.
*-st*, *-ft*, *-scht*, *-lt*, *-nt*, *-mt*, *-kt*, â€¦ you name it.
Putting the `D` in the rightmost column of your right hand allows for that without any special rules.
To keep the partial symmetry intact, the `D-` of your left hand, is also placed in the outermost column.
