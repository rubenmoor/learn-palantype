# Stage 6

### Exercise 1

## Long vowels

### Greediness 0

You might have wondered why there is no key for *h* for your right hand.
Vowels that are being stretched out, e.g. with an *h*, are typed using one of the stretch keys.
You can call `~` stretch or *Dehnung*.
With `~` you can stretch any of the vowels of your right hand.
In order to stretch the vowels of your left hand, you have Ü, which doubles as a second stretch key.

<!--separator-->

Note that the stretch key isn't only for *h*, but it also turns *i* into *ie*.
There is something to say about *ie* in words like «Linie», «Serie» oder «Aktie».
In these words, technically, the letters *i* and *e* do not have anything to do with vowel stretching.
In order to learn how to type fast, this is of no concern.
Just treat all cases of *ie* the same.
