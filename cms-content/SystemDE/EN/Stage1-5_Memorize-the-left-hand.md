### Exercise 5

## The Palantype Alphabet

You get the virtual keyboard back.
Feel free, to toggle it anytime.
You can even use `N+M` to do that.
This is one of the command keys.
You will later learn that it is meant to replace the insert key on your keyboard.

Type every steno letter as it appears!

The `-` symbol is used to distinguish between letters that appear twice.
In this task, you will only need your left hand.
Thus the letters have a trailing `-`.

<!--separator-->

Fun fact: The letter *t* is more common in German than *d*, still there is only the `D` key.
The reason is that *d* is reasonably frequent in the onset (the beginning) of syllables
and by encoding *t* as `D+-` and `-+D`, respectively,
we end up with a somewhat consistent rule for the use of `+`: It converts the soft letters
*b*, *d*, and *g* into their hard counterparts *p*, *t*, and *k*.

Later on you will realize that in a lot of cases, a *t* in the coda
(the final part of a syllable) can be typed using `D` without the `+`.
The concept behind all this is to have a complete rule set that allows to reach each and any German word first.
Then additional rules are added to increase typing efficiency.
