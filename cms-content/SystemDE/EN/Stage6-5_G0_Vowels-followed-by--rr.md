### Exercise 5

## Vowels followed by -rr

### Greediness 0

Following the idea of stretching vowels, a *rr* is yet another way to stretch a vowel and it's typed using the `+` key.

<!--separator-->

Do not let the appearance of *t* in the patterns disturb you.
There is a simple reason: You have learned to type *t* using `+D` in [Exercise 3.1](DE/13).
Naively following the rule of reaching *rr* using `+` would require the `+` key twice for *rrt*,
which is impossible, at least without some explicit rule.
You might also notice that there is no way to distinctly type *rrd*,
which luckily does not exist in the German language.
