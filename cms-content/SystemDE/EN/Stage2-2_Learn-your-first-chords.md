# Stage 2

### Exercise 2

## Syllables and chords

We can begin with actually typing sentences now.
How about this quote from Goethe?
In case you have trouble with keys that appear twice on the steno keyboard:
There is always only exactly one correct key that results in the desired output.

<!--separator-->

Each word is one chord, except the word «Zweifel».
You will have to strike `ʃG+EI` and `FEL` separately.
For this reason, the steno code for «Zweifel» is typically denoted `ʃG+EI/FEL`, with a `/`.

You will probably need an additional chord to clear this task: `I+NSD`.
It is the home row of your right hand and deletes your last input.
Now you can correct your mistakes!
